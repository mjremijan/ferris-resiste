The pair form up as they move toward their farthest point from Earth, when the effects of Earth's gravitational pull is smaller, meaning formation flying can be maintained with very little propellant.</p><p>Next, the challenge will be getting the spacecraft's payloads ready and then aligning the pair with the sun to create <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/when-next-total-solar-eclipse-us"><u>total solar eclipses</u></a>.</p><p>"We can't wait to see the completion of the instrument calibration and the first processed image of the sun's corona," Galano said.</p> ]]>

A **RE**ally **SI**mple **S**yndication **T**o **E**mail system

This is a Java stand-alone RSS to email client.  The binary of this project
can be downloaded, unziped, configured, and run with no additional server setup
needed (it even comes with it's own JRE so not even Java needs to be installed
on the server). 

See the project's documentation for more details.
